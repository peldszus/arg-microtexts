Rent increases upon re-letting aren't bad as such, if it's only a small amount, they’re very bad however, if the rent suddenly climbs by €100 or €200. With those kinds of amounts you think twice about whether you really want to stay in the flat. If there must be rent increases, there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises. This helps the landlords, as they can adjust their expenses through the increase, and also the tenants, as they can plan for a maximum rent increase. That the landlords are then slightly restricted in the administration of their property is not a problem, as they have more pull in the end anyway.
